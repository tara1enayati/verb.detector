 Verb Detection in English Sentences

This project is a simple Python implementation that detects verbs in English sentences. It uses basic linguistic rules and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify verbs within the input text.

This code's Features:
- Detects verbs in a sentence.
- Processes multiple sentences.
- Provides a simple and efficient approach to basic verb recognition.

 How It Works:
The code identifies verbs by leveraging:
- Tokenization of sentences into words.
- Tagging each word with its respective part of speech (POS).
- Extracting words tagged as verbs.

How to Install it:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/verb-detection.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

What is its Usage:
1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python verb_detection.py
    ```
2. Input your sentences and the program will output the detected verbs.

## Example
Input:
```
The dog is running in the park.
```

Output:
```
Detected verb: running
```
Future Improvements
- Support for different verb tenses and forms.
- Improved accuracy by handling complex sentence structures.
- Adding low-resource languages.
